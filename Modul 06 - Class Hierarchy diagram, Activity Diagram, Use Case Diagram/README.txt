Create a simple program based on the class diagram image above. This program functions to order cellphones and vouchers. This program can view cellphones and vouchers available in the shop, order cellphones by entering the quantity and cost of the goods ordered, order vouchers by entering the cost plus tax, view orders for goods and enter new cellphones or vouchers into the shop.

This program has 3 menus, namely Order Items, View Orders and New Items. The Order Items menu displays a list of available items, namely cellphones and vouchers. If the item is not available it will display "item not available". After selecting the item the user will be asked to enter the item ID. If the user types "0" and the user selects an item ID that is not in the list, he will return to the main menu. After the user selects the item ID, if it is a cellphone, it will ask for the number of items, the number of items must be above zero or less than stock. Users will
asked to enter a price that corresponds to the cost of the order, if the voucher will be subject to additional tax.
