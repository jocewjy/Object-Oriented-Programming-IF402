Create a simple program that functions to order goods available in an office stationery store. This program can view the items available in the store, order items by entering the quantity and cost of the items ordered, and view item orders. This program has 2 menus, namely Order Goods and View Orders. The Order Items menu displays a list of available items, then the user will be asked to enter the item ID. 

If the user types 0 and the user selects an item ID that is not in the list, it will return to the main menu. After the user selects the item ID, he will be asked for the number of items, the number of items must be above zero or less than stock. Users will be asked to enter a price that corresponds to the order cost.
